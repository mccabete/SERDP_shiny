## Climate Change Impacts on Fire Regimes, Plant Invasions and Tick-Borne Diseases
<br><br>



Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) represent a major public health threat in North America, particularly for military personnel training on Department of Defense (DoD) installations. We received funding from the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program to explore several of the predicted consequences of climate change on fire regimes and plant communities, and their interactions with wildlife, for human risk of exposure to TBDs in the southeastern U.S.
